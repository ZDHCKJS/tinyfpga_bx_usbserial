# TinyFPGA BX USB Serial

![](usb_ser_ice40_detail.png)

## Origins

Luke Valenti's USB module, as adapted by Lawrie Griffiths and others.  Luke's code was created with the purpose of providing a "bit banged" USB port to SPI bridge for his (awesome) TinyFPGA boards.

The original is here - https://github.com/tinyfpga/TinyFPGA-Bootloader

Lawrie Griffiths dug into the dark innards of this code and did the bulk of the work to change it to being a USB - SERIAL bridge, looking to the user like a serial port, rather than an SPI master.  He also created some great examples.  His work is here - https://github.com/lawrie/tiny_usb_examples

However there were a couple of problems:
- arachne-pnr would give spotty results, sometimes not working at all.  This is easy to understand when considering that arachne-pnr *does not place in such a way as to minimize timings!*  NextNPR is a must.
- the original code has a few places where it violates Verilog rules (mostly fixed by smunaut and submitted as a pull request https://github.com/tinyfpga/TinyFPGA-Bootloader/pull/21)

## This Project

This project makes the above changes, and fixes one or two other small issues.  Importantly, it also replaces the front end to the code with a pipeline interface.  This last thing is what makes this project more fork-y and less pull-request-y with respect to Lawrie's repo.

The key to the streaming pipeline interface is that there are three ports: `data`, `valid`, and `ready`.  A sender will place new data on the `data` port and raise the `valid` flag.  If a receiver is ready to receive, it will raise the `ready` flag.  So in any connection there will be two signals generated by the sender (`data` and `valid`) and one by the receiver `ready`.  And here's the key part *if `valid` and `ready` are both raised at the same time the data is considered to be transfered*.   This interface can clunk along - the sender raising valid now and then, and provided the `ready` signal is raised, data will flow, but pretty amazingly, this interface can really rock - if there is data to be had at every clock cycle, just leave `valid` and `ready` on and one word of data will flow *at each clock*.

This works pretty well and has been tested at full speed using some Python code.

The USB code alone (with virtually no other functionality at all) uses 15% of the device's LUT's.  Here's the NextPNR output:

```

**Interface**

The interface to the code looks like the following:

```
usb_uart_i40 u_u_i40 (
  .clk_48mhz  (clk_48mhz),
  .reset      (reset),

  // pins
  .pin_usb_p( pin_usb_p ),
  .pin_usb_n( pin_usb_n ),

  // uart pipeline in
  .uart_in_data( uart_in_data ),
  .uart_in_valid( uart_in_valid ),
  .uart_in_ready( uart_in_ready ),

  // uart pipeline out
  .uart_out_data( uart_out_data ),
  .uart_out_valid( uart_out_valid ),
  .uart_out_ready( uart_out_ready ),
);
```

**Clock**

You will need a 48Mhz clock.  This can be generated by pll from the TinyFPGA BX's 12Mhz oscillator.

```
SB_PLL40_CORE #(
		.FEEDBACK_PATH("SIMPLE"),
		.DIVR(4'b0000),		// DIVR =  0
		.DIVF(7'b0101111),	// DIVF = 47
		.DIVQ(3'b100),		// DIVQ =  4
		.FILTER_RANGE(3'b001)	// FILTER_RANGE = 1
	) uut (
		.LOCK(locked),
		.RESETB(1'b1),
		.BYPASS(1'b0),
		.REFERENCECLK(clock_in),
		.PLLOUTCORE(clock_out)
		);
```

In this project, the pll is contained in its own module (pll.v) that is created by the IceStorm project tool `icepll`.

Amazingly, this can also be done by dividing down a faster clock.  Using an `icepll` generated 192MHz clock, a 48MHz signal can be derived the simple way, by divider, and (possibly unnecessarily) put through the global buffer network for distribution.  This worked for a few experiments, but probably requires more development and testing to confirm.

```
wire clk_192mhz;
wire clk_locked;

// Use an icepll generated pll to give us 192MHz
pll pll192( .clock_in(pin_clk), .clock_out(clk_192mhz), .locked(clk_locked) );

reg [4:0] reset_counter = 0;

// Generate the slower clock
reg       clk_48mhz_logic;
reg [1:0] clk_divider;
always @(posedge clk_192mhz ) begin
    if ( ~clk_locked ) begin
        clk_divider <= 0;
    end else begin
        case (clk_divider)
            0: begin
                clk_48mhz_logic <= 1;
                clk_divider <= 1;
            end
            1: begin
                clk_divider <= 2;
            end
            2: begin
                clk_48mhz_logic <= 0;
                clk_divider <= 3;
            end
            3: begin
                clk_divider <= 0;
            end
      endcase
  end
end

// This clock has to go places.  Put it through a global buffer
wire clk_48mhz;
SB_GB gbc(
    .USER_SIGNAL_TO_GLOBAL_BUFFER (clk_48mhz_logic),
    .GLOBAL_BUFFER_OUTPUT ( clk_48mhz ) );
```

**Device Pins**

The pins above (`pin_usb_p` and `pin_usb_n`) are the raw device pins, the direction control logic is internal to `usb_uart_i40`.  The original usb_uart module is retained below to facilitate reuse in other architectures.

Somewhere the USB pull up pin has to be asserted.  This is done in the top level code, since usb_uart doesn't manipulate it.

```
assign pin_pu = 1'b1;
```

**Pipeline Interface**

There are two pipeline interfaces to the module, `uart_in` and `uart_out`.  The former being a pipeline *receiver* and the latter being a pipeline *sender*.  The naming can be a bit confusing.  `uart_in` is into the module, out of the device, into the host, `uart_out` is out of the host, into the device, out of the module.

These can just be tied together (as they are in this project) to create a UART loopback.

## Use

Development has been done on Ubuntu.  

Clone the repo

```
git clone git@github.com:davidthings/tinyfpga_bx_usbserial.git
```

and enter the directory

`cd tinyfpga_bx_usbserial`

And make it!

`make`

The make process has got to do a few things so it may take a minute.

If it completes successfully, press the "program" button on the TinyFPGA BX and program it

`make prog`

If all went well, you will then see a new port which you can connect to with a serial terminal emulator (on Ubuntu the port is /dev/ttyACM0 and a good terminal program is **gtkterminal** since it doesn't seem to get upset if you forget to disconnect before reprogramming).  

For this demo, characters typed are rather unspectacularly just echo'ed back.

`make gui`

Let's you perform the place and route manually and generate pretty pictures like the one at the top.  And this one.

## Issues

**32 Byte transfer limit**

The code presented works at full speed, transferring data at 48Mhz, but somewhere in the USB code, something makes any attempts to transfer more than 32 bytes at a time fail.  This limit is fine for some applications, but obviously not for others.  If someone out there knows more about USB, please feel free to help fix this.

**Pipeline Interface**

Run slowly, the pipeline is pretty simple.  Data is available (`valid`), receiver (signaling `ready`) receives it.  Wait.  Repeat.  You can certainly use it in a simple way by de-asserting `ready` every cycle forcing the interface into a two step (`valid` `ready`, `valid` `~ready`).  The logic to do this is pretty simple.

Where the pipeline shines is when data is streaming - one in, one out every clock cycle, (as happens in multibyte transfers), but for a simple seeming interface, a pipeline like this can be *fiendishly* complex to implement.  Implementers *must* have a firm grasp on their `=`'s vs `<=`'s, know their `always @(*)`'s from their `always @(posedge clk)`'s, and really understand combinatorial vs registered signals.  

Here's a taste.  Consider a pipeline module, m with both upstream and downstream communicating partners.  The main area of complexity happens when data is streaming (`valid` and `ready` are asserted by all) and suddenly the downstream module lowers `ready`.  When this happens module m has to latch the data its sending (since data is transferred only when *both* parties agree), hold `valid` high and wait.  Meanwhile the upstream module's data *was considered transfered*.  So the poor module m in the middle has to both latch its data word and store the new overflow one.  Then when the downstream module finally signals that it's ready, module m first needs to unload the original data, then the stored overflow data, and only then can it start accepting data again.  Getting all this in your head and implemented correctly can take days.

Mr ZipCPU talks about pipelining a lot here - https://zipcpu.com/blog/2017/08/14/strategies-for-pipelining.html . He uses "STB" and "Busy" as his signals, but his development of the subject is pretty nice.

Feel free to use this interface, or put another one on it!

**Command Line**

There are rumors that some people don't like command-line tools.  If you (or a friend) think you might be one of these people, please feel free to connect this project to your other fancy environment (Apio, PlatformIO) and submit the appropriate files so others may experience these delights.

**Accuracy / Mistakes / Etc.**
